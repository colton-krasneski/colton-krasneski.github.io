<h1>Orgin of Colton's gameplay school</h1><br/>
<strong>Colton's gameplay school - preview took over 2 years to make</strong><br/>
<strong>It was inspired by the computer game prodigy along with the buttons and assets</strong><br/>
<strong>The Mobs were inspired by the games Earth Bound- Starman, Mario - Boom Boom, Minecraft - Piglin, NES + super smash bros. - R.O.B</strong><br/>
<strong>The assets were inspired by some games the name button allows you to pick your name which was also inspired by prodigy, The comment button was just a fun asset made to allow you to type comments, The Switch Gender button was inspired by myself, And the mailbox and shop were inspired by Bryan's Page's Dungeon Crawl</strong><br/>
<strong>Further in the development the enemies got spawn rates starman is the most rare and the Zombie is the most common along with Boom</strong>
<strong>The following quote will tell you something important: No matter how hard you try you can always make a difference big or small, And if you don't at least you tried</strong><br/>
<strong>I hope you enjoyed our development remember that quote very wise</strong>
